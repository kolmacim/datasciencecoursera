<h1>Steps in Analysis</h1>

<ul>
	<li>All files were imported in the first stage                                                                               </li>
	<li>Column binding of Train and Test data with labels and merging them into one dataset    </li>
	<li>Putting the labels on merged dataset                                                                                   </li>
	<li>Extract only mean and standard deviation for each measurement                                     </li>
	<li>Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set                            </li>
	<li>Modify column names in order to make them more clean and understandable                  </li>
	<li>Create new, tidy dataset with average of each variable grouped by activity and subject </li>
</ul>
